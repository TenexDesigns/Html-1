*               ********** POSITIONS IN HTML  **********

1. static: Default one.
2. relative : Same as static.But it removes the item with the relative posion form the floe/dom/html view in browser.
   But it lets you add top, right, bottom, left.Adding relative does not change the order of the original elements ,sice the item is pushed from its original/relative positioni.e The space from which the elemnt is pushed top,or left is not occupied
   This only moves the item relative to the oarent it is contained in.
3. absolute: Removes the item with the absolute position from the flow/dom/html view  and  .The position previously occupied by the item is occupied the next items that follow it.
   The item is completely reoved from the dom and floats above it and can be position with top,left etc.The item can be placed anywhere on the view page.e.g top bottom.
   Else it considers the main html element as the  parent.How ever we can put this item in a parent item with a position of relative .Then we can put this absolute item ,relative to that item. i.e Inside the parent item that has any other position aside from relative.
4. fixed : Fixed to a place.An moves as you move while fixed to that place Doesn't give two shits about the parent.It moves as you scroll. Always considers html element as the parent. Stays there when scrolled.
5. sticky : Relative ( when normal) + fixed ( when scrolled). The values for top, right, bottom, left become active when scrolled

*               ********** Pseudo selectors **********

*   Pseudo selectors  - This are only two i.e ::before and ::after.
*                     - They add or implement css before and after the selected item  e.g <div> name </div>
*                     - e.g div::after{
*                                content:"**",
*                               background:''red',}
*                               
*                     -   This gives us a result of-  name**          
*                               
*                     - e.g div::before{
*                                content:"**",
*                               background:''red',}
*                               
*                     -   This gives us a result of-  **name   
*                               
*  Attribute selectors     - This is like a selector for elements with the.. data-"" .. atribute.
*                          - We put this data-"" in the elememnt and then in the css we select this element 
*                          - with [] the square brackets. e.g
*                                <div data-book > Name </div>                         
*                        in the css  [data-book]{                                     
*                                     background="red" }
*                          - How ever we can can be specific on which element with the attribiute selector to choose
*                               e.g  <div data-book="name">Name </div>
*                                     [data-book=""name]{
*                                           background:'red'}   
*                               
*                               NOTE--> Its like class selectors but on steroids using [] 
*                               Thsi can be used to select elements with start ,middle and  finishing characters
*                                     start - ^    e.g [data-book^="na"]
*                                     middle - *   e.g [data-book*="am"]     
*                                     finish - $   e.g [data-book^="me"]
*                               
*                               
*                    ********** Transform **********          
*            This can be used to alter the position of a element.
*             It has the folowing :   rotate()           Is used to rotate the component in degrees i..e deg
*                                     scale()            Is used to scale the element
*                                     skew()             Is used to strech the element on the X or Y axis
*                                     translate()        Is used to change the position of an element.You can put the iten you want to translate in a container with relative position and the elemnt to be in abslote position

*                                      
*                     We can also use css variables to change may be one aspect of the transform
*               E.g Here we set the values uin a css variable
*                                                            --> transform: translateY(var(--transy,50px) ) translateX(var(--transx,90px));           
*                   We can change this value by refing to the class with the above characteristic by  
*                                                            --> .big{--transy:90px;}
*                                                                                                      
*                               
*                    ********** CSS variables **********          
*             A css variable starts with two hyphens and then the variable name.Then we give it a normal value like any other css selector.
*             We then refer to the values  in the  css valuables by usin the tag ---> var()   e.g    var(--book)
*                               e.g --kitchen:red
*                                   --book:10px
*
* Now .Where can we apply this css variable. We can use this to store certain variables that we can reuse in the css               
*    we can store this values in e.g :root {}    this is same as the html selector tag                         
*     :root{
*          --div-background:red;
*          --p-color:white;                            
*          }
              
*      P{                         
*        backround:var(--div-background);                       
*        color:var(--p-color);                       
*        }                      
*                               
*         We UPDATE the values in the css variables in the following way.                      
*       p{                        
*         --p-color:green;                      
*        }                       
*                               
*          Now here in this  css variable ,The drop back value is applied if the css varaible is not available
*          Here the value of green s applied as the background since there is no shelf with any value.                     
*              P{                                                
*                 background-color:var(--shelf,green)   }            
*                               
*            We can use this to change the background of our website from light to dark                   
*            Here ,the we set  --website-background css variable to no value but give it a value to drop back to .which will be the lighy theme                    
*            To change the background of the website,we give the  --website-background a value  black ,which which will nullyfy the drop back value of the light theme.                   
*                               
*               heres how we do it in java script.                    
*                               
*                    document.getElementById('dark-theme-btn').addEventListener
*                       ('click',()=>{
*                           document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--website-background','black')
*                       })
*                       
*                       document.getElementById('light-theme-btn').addEventListener
*                       ('click',()=>{
*                           document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--website-background','white')
*                       })
