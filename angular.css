/**
 *                        Angular architecture
 *    Angular app - is made up of one or more MODULES
 *    Module  - is made up of one or more COMPONENT and SERVICES
 *    Component - is made up of HTML  and a  CLASS
 *    Service - Where the business logic of your application is stored
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *                             ***********PARTS OF ANGULAR COMPONENT **********
 *            TEMPLETE -Contains the html of the component
 *             CLASS - Contains the code in type script ,the data & methods for the component
 *              METADATA -Contains the decorators which tell angular the type of component this is
 * 
*
* *              In Agular we have  Components like in react.This componets are used to host
 *              Different parts of the app 
 * 
 *      CREATING COMPONENTS 
 * .....There are three steps to creating a component in angulars js
 *             1.creating a component
 *              2.Regester that component in a module
 *               3. Add an elememt in an HTML mark up. 
 *  
 * 
 * 1. Creating a component
 *   When creating a component in angular , we follow this convention  
 * 
 *  name.component.ts        // If a component has multiple names we speparate using  hyphen
 *
 * In the component , make and export a classs.We export thee class to make it visible outside of the  component
 * The class componen t contains data that cam be redered in the view via the html in  the templete
 * Name  the class using camel casig i.e first leter is capital only
 *     
 * export class Torchcompont{ 
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * To make the named class a component ,import and instanciet the {Component} decoorator from the angular core libray
 *       import { Component} from '@angular/core'
 *
 *          @Component(
 *                        {
 *                          selector:'courses',                            //Angular uses this to dispaly the contnt in this component(or the templete) as html  e.g in index html to diplsy the coneten in this component/templete, we type <courses><courses/>  based on the name give to the selectors.. that is right ,this are custom tags in angular.
 *                         template:"<h2>Courses</h2>"                     //Defines the html  to be rendered in from this component.The html for this templete or component can be directly written like above or written in another file and imported as "templeteURL:'./files/index.html'"
 *                          stylesUrls:[]
 *                          } 
 *               )
 *              export class Torchcomponent{ }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * ********note*********** There are THREE ways of creatinfg a SELECTOR  1. Create custom tag as seen above. selector:'courses'   to refer to the custom html tag created <courses><courses/>  
 *                                                                       2. Create the selector as a class e.g selector: ".courses"    to refer to the html tag with a class of courses i.e <div class="courses">
 *  *                                                                    3. create selector in square brackets e.g selector: [courses]  and refer to it in a html tag e.g <div courses>
 *  
 * * ********note*********** There are three ways of creating a templete to render html:   1 . Creating HTML in ONE LINE using quotation marks   e.g   template:"<h2>Courses</h2>" 
 *                                                                                          2.  Creating HTML in MULTIPLE LINES using backticks     e.g  template: `<h1>  Hellow eliud <h1/>
 *                                                                                                                                                   <div>Hwllow george<div/>`
 *                                                                                          3. Creating an eternal html file and refering to it via templete url e.g  templateUrl:'./app.component.html' 
 * 
 * * ********note*********** There are THREE ways of creating a Styles to render css : 1. Writing the css inline in multile lines using back ticks e.g style:[`div{
 *                                                                                                                                                                  color:red 
 *                                                                                                                                                            }`]
 *                                                                                     2. Writing the css in an external file and refering to it via url styleUrl:['.app.component.css] 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  2       REGESTER THAT COMPONET IN  A MODULE 
 *     a.     We make a module file  following the cvection of name.module.ts
 *                  app.module.ts      
 *     
 *     b.   In this module file we imort a {Ngmodule} decoration from    angular/core 
 *          We instanciet the Ngmodule and pass in it declrations of the  imported components
 *                  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
 * /*                        @ngmodule/{
 *                                       declaration:[{ 
 *                                                Torchcomponet
 *                                                     }]
 *                                       }  
 * 
 * 
 *      3 Add the custom element created using selector  in the compoent 
 *            i.e  
 *          @Component(
 *                 selector:'courses',                        //This 'courses'  .We add it as a custom html component
 *                 template:"<h2>Courses</h2>"  
 *                    )
 *              export class Torchcomponent{}
 *                       
 * 
 *           We add this custom html component in a html file e.g app.component.html , in order for the html in the Torchcomponent to be renderd i.e the  <h2>courses<h/> 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *    <*********************  NOTE: Using NG to generate compomemts *********************>
 *          Instaed of going Through the above pain and all of that code.Angular can automaticlay generate a component
 *           for you with  css, module and the component itself by using the following command 
 *                     ************ ng g c <name> *************
 * That is ng generate component <name>        e.g  ng g c course     //This generates a componwnt callled course
 *      ng g  
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *                                     ********************* Interpolation ************
 *          This is redering information from class onto html view using double brackets 
 *           Within this brackets we can do all javascript methods e.g addition         <h1>{{2+2}}<h1/>
 *  *                                                                 concarination       <h1>{{"This is "+title}}<h1/>
 *                                                                     call methods         <h1>{{greetuser()}}<h1/>       
 *                                                                                      <h1>{{title.lenth}}<h1/>
 *         Note: You can note assign values using interpolation 
 *                     NOT ALLLOWED e.g  Global javascript variable e.g windows
 *                                       Assignment of varables e.g a =7
 * 
*                          But you can do all of this in the class 
 * 
 *                  Example:  ----->
 * 
 *                            @Component(
 *                                        selector:'courses', 
 *                                       template:"<h2>{{title}}</h2>"               
 *                                              )
 *                                     export class Torchcomponent{
 *                                               title= "Helllow George"                              // By default all named things are given public access modifiers. This title is the same as saying public title =""
 *                     
 * 
 *                                 }
 *

 *                                       *******************   Property Binding   **************
 *                                       
 *                         Atributes - They do not change and are for the HTML
 *                         Property - They can change and are for the DOM
 *                       To enable property binding we use SQUARE BRACKETS  or the BIND-  e.g [id] or bind-id 
 * 
 *                 To enable Change of property in angular we use square brackets around the property e.g <input [disabled] ="isDisabled"><input/>        
 *                  This is called property binding                                                                           export class Torchcomponent{
 *                  We do this because some properties may not work in angular                                                isDisabled= "true"          
 *                  e.g if we use  disabled without the propperty binding,it is set to true and cant be changed                                                                                                                    }
 *                   How ever if we use property binding ,we can change the diable property  in the class  or inline                                                                                              
 *                      We CAN NOT  use interpolation e.g <input disabled ={{isDisabled}}><input/>    
 *                        This is because interpolation works only for string values
 *                         In the above exaple disabled takes in boolean values.There for interpolation wont work for it                                                                                      
 * 
 * 
 *                   ****** Note normal class and property bound class .If used together ,The property bound class gets excuted as it has moore ponts

 *                         use class binding dot the desired class to be rendred contionaly  and equet it to the true or false epression

 * 
 *                              This can be used to render styles on html tags 
 *                              How we do this is by writting styles dot the style property we want to change e.g color ,font. Then we put the style value between sigle quotes in the quotattion marks e.g "'red','green'"
 *                             <h1 [style.color] ="'red'">     Helllow World <h1/>

 * 
 *                      Event binding lets you listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.     
 *                       To bind to an event you use the Angular event binding syntax. 
 *                       This syntax consists of a target event name within parentheses to the left of an equal sign, and a quoted template statement to the right.
 *                           e.g <button (click)="onClick()">Add</button> 
 *                                                   export class Torchcomponent{
 *                                                              onClick(){
 *                                                                     console.log("Hellow World")
 *                                                                   }                                          
 *

 *                             It is precceded with a hash. It is used to identify the value received from users imput or dom variables
 *                            e.g #variable

 *                       This is used to sync or update the data in the class as the user inputs it.
 *                       This makes use of Property binding(), and event binding[]  i.e [()]
 *                       
 *                   
 *                       It makes use of the ngModel, e.g [(ngModel)] =""
 *                       The ngModel has to imported in the root app.model  from the form module
 *  
 *                                                 <input [(ngModule)]="name"  type="text">

 * 
 *                   e.g <h1 *ngIf="true">Hellow WOrld<h1/>          //This html element will be visible
 *                   e.g <h1 *ngIf="false">Hellow WOrld<h1/>         // This html elenemt will not be visible
 *                
 *                   This *ngIf can also take an else statememnt i.e if the ng is false ,Another html elememnt will be rendred in its place
 *                   Precced the desired html elememnt by enclosing it in <ng templete> and give this ng temlete a templete refernce variable                 
 *                   The ng templete is used to enclose html elemnts that can be used by the ng directive
 *                      <h1 *ngIf="false";  else elseBlock >Hellow WOrld<h1/>
 *                             <ng templete #elseblock >

 * 
 *                     There Cna aslo be another way of displaying this. If the ngIf is true THEN it diplays the theb block,else if it is false ,it Displays the else block 
 * 
 *  *                      < div   *ngIf="false"; then thenblock   else elseBlock ><div/>

 *
 *
 *                    The parent component send the data trouch the custom html selector tag ot the child component
 *                        e.g selector:'courses',                         //Child component
 *                           <courses [parentData]="name"><courses/>      //child component  . The "name is the data being passsed from  parent component to child componenet"
 * 
 *                
 *                      This is how we acess the data sent from the parent component. We precced the receing part with an @input() decorator that is imported
 *                                 <h1>{{"Hellow"+ parentData}}<h1/>
 *                                  export class Torchcomponent{
 *                                  @input() parentData;                                                                                                             
 *                                                                         
 *                                     } 
 * 
 *                      We can also give the precceing part a dirreernt name that is custom to this component
 *  *                     <h1>{{"Hellow"+ name}}<h1/>
 *                       export class Torchcomponent{

 * 
 * 
 *                    *********************  SENDING DATA FROM CHILD TO PARENT  *********************
 * 
 *                  The child has no parent selector component i.e [parentData] . Ther for the data from the childe is sent 
 *                  to the parent through events that are emitted via the @output() decorator
 *            
 *                   To create an event to send data to the parent componet .We create the event throuth the eventemitter
 *                   and then export it via the @output() decorator 
 *     
 *                  @output()  childEvent = new EventEmitter
 * 
 *                  childEvent.emit("This is the data to be sent from child to parent")
 * 
 * 
 *                  To Receive the data from the  child in the parent component . we use (childEvent) to signify reception of the data and $event is the data.We put the data in a custom variable i.e "message" 
 *                 we use (chileEvent) = "message=$event"
 * 
 * 
 *                                     ********************* PIPES  *********************

 *                     This is a component with a specific purpose only
 *                            This purpose can be
 *                                           1. To share date to other components
 *                                           2. Implement application logic
 *                                           3.External interaction e.g receive data from APIs
 *                          Naming convention is <name>.service.ts

 *                                     <!  **** Dependency Injection **** !>
 *                        
 *                      Dependency injection is a codding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from
 *                      external sources rather than creating them itself
 *                     The DI framework provides an injector which houses all the dependacies needed by the component
 *                     Then this injector provides this dependencies when needed by the component.
 * 
 *                               1. Define the class i.e To define a service component we use>>>>>>> ng g s <service name> i.e emplyeeservice.serve.ts
 *                               2. Rejester the class with angulars injector in the 
 *                                 app module in Provides to make it accessible to all components in 
 *                                  the app module i.e  providers: [<sevice name>
 * 
 *                                 app module    {
 *                                                  providers: [emplyeeservice],
 *                                               } 
 * 
 * 
 *                               3. Declare as dependancy where needed 
 *                                  This <service> namy contain a list of employess needede in e.g an employeelist component .
 *                                  For the data to move from the service component we put it in a method in the service component
 *                                 e.g <service component>
 *                                     employeelistmethod(){
 *                                return ["george","eliud"]
 *                                         }
 *                                
 *                                 For The data to be received in the desired component.
 *                                We declare whre the data is to be received 
 *                                     public employeelist=[]
 *                                We  then receivr the data in the constructor  via custom service name in the component to receive the dtate from the 
 *                                    constroctor(private _customsrvicename :emplyeservice){
 *

 * 
 *                              We then nees to use the ngOnint method to receive the data and give it to the declared recierveer  i.e public employee list=[]
 *                              for the data to be called we  use the custom servise name to clall the metod containing the data in the employee service
 *                                        
 *                               ----> public employee list = []

 *                             This data may come from a data base or server .To get the data we use http request                            
 *                             The response with the data comes back to the http.

 *                           This is a sequence of items /sequence of http response that arrive asynchronasly over time
 *                                Hppt call = single item
 *                                single item = http response 
 * 
 *                      RxJs - Reactive Extensions for Javascript
 *                             This is an external libray that enables us to work with observables
 * 
 *                                              ************** HTTP ******************
 *          To enale This .We use HttpClient modue in app module .We include it in the imports
 *             i.e imports :[httpclientmodule]
 *
 *            In  the service we include the httpclient as a dependacy in the constructor
 *      
 *                    constructor(private _http: HttpClient) { }
 *                                                     }
 *             
 *            To make the get request ,we use the custom http name i.e _http in a method
 *                            getemployes(){
 *                                    return this._http.get("url")
 *                                        }
 * 
 *           WE aslso need to add an observable and an interface to the method and the get reqesst
 *            The interface describes the structure of the data to be received
 *   e.g export interfac InterfaceEmolpye{
 *                               id:number,
 *                               name:string,
 *                               age:number,}
 *
 *               Now we  need to add the  Observable and intrface.Observable starts with a capital letter
 *
 *  *                            getemployes():Observable <interfaceEmployee []/>{
 *                                    return this._http.get:<interfaceemployee[]/>("url")
 *                                        }
 * 
 * 
 *               
 *               Then you need to subscribe to the obsevable in the components that requre this data
 *                This subscribtion is done after the  method in the service thats giving the data is called 
 *                On subscribing to the observable ,we need to assign the data received to a local variable
 *                 You subscribe in the onInt method
 *
 * *                            ------> public employee list = []                     //This is the local variable receiving the data
 *                              |
 *                              |     constroctor(private _customsrvicename :emplyeservice){
 *  *    This puts the list     |
 *    gotten from  the service  |                }
 * *  into here in the          |
 *       employee list          |        ngOnint (){
 *                              |_______ this._customservicename.getemployes()
 *                                                              .subscribe( datareceived => this.employeellist = datareceived )            // This assigns the data received to a local  variable
 * 
 *                                             }
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  *                                         ************** Handleing Http errors ******************
 *                                  The http error handling is done whre the http request is made i.e In the service component
 *                                  We import a http error handler provided by angular 
 *                                             import 'rxjs/add/operator/catch'
 *                                        
 *                                  We then  neee to add a CATCH method that holds the error handler method
 *                                  This method will be called every time ther is an error   
 *
 *                                   getemployes():Observable <interfaceEmployee []/>{
 *                                              return this._http.get:<interfaceemployee[]/>("url")
 *                                                               .catch(this.errorhandlermethod)
 *                                                                                            }
 *                                                errorhandlermethod(errro:HttpErrorResponse){
 *                                                                                          }   
 *NOTE ** The roor handler method receices a parametr error of type HttpErrorResponse. This HttpErrorResponse is imported 
 *                         
 *                                     The service component has no html to display the error .
 *                                     How ever components that have subscribed to the Observable have access to the  servce
 *                                     So we throw an error through the observable that can can be accesed by components that have subscribe to the obsevable
 *                                     We also have to import the observable   i.e import 'rxjs/add/Observable/throw'
 *                                                                
 * *                                                errorhandlermethod(errro:HttpErrorResponse){
 *                                                          return Observable.throw(error.message || server errro)   
 *                                                                                          } 
 *                                  
 *                                        Now we have throw our http error to the subscribed components
 *                                        Now its time for the subscribed components to take the error and display it in the view or html
 *                                                   In the Subscribed component 
 *                                                       
 *                        // Declare a valiable to receive the error

 *
 *
 *                                To enable use of buton to navigate to the routes we  use anchor tags with routerlinks
 *                                    <a routerLinks ="/departments"> Departments</a>
 *
 *  
 *                              We give the routerLinkActive , directive a class of e.g "active" to apply classes to give the dutton or ancor tag style

 *
 *                        Wild card routes are routes that do not exist .To avoid an error on the browser. We can filter all pages that are not regestered in our website
 *                        To capture all wild route, we use the double asterisc "**" and a component where all the traffic will be directed to
 *
 *
 *                                          import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
 *                                          import { DepartmentComponent } from './department/department.component';
 *                                          import { ErroPageNotfound } from './department/department.component';
 *                                                  
 *   //Here is whre we regester             const routes: Routes = [
 *   //the wild cardsto be directed to                 {path:'department',component:DepartmentComponent},
 *   //a default error component                          {path:'**',component:ErroPageNotfound}
 *                                                             ];
 *
 * *
 *              Note : Angular excutes code from the top to the bottom. So always put the wild cards at the bottom

 *                                             -This is heavy on using the templete component
 *                                             -I.e Most of the code is written in the templete component 
 * 
 * *                                     1. Reactive forms
 *                                            -This is heavy on using the templete component
 * *                                          -I.e Most of the code is written on the class component

 * * ** *                                        ************** Templete Driven Forms In Angular ******************
 *
 *                                                 - This relies mostly on the html in the template
 *                                                 - Two way data binding is mostly used with the ngModel
 **                                                - It leads to bulky html and less component code
 **                                                - Automaticaly tracks the forms state and form elememts state and validity
 **                                                 
 *                                    Drawbacks    - Readability decreases with comples forms and validations  
 **                                                - Unit testing is a challenge 
 **                                                - Go with Templete forms where validation can be done on the browser.  
 * **                                              - But for complex validations , go with reactive forms    
 **                                                - The tdf are suitable for simple sinarios

 *                                       To start working with forms in angular .Import the Forms Module in the app.modules and include it in the  imports
 **                                            import {formsModule} from '@angular/core' 
 *                                                     imports:{    
 *                                                        browsermodule,
 **                                                       formsmodule
*                                                                }

 **                                       Now In the component with the form. We are give access to the value in the form by the ngForm module created by formsmoduel          
 **                                        Now the form values are stored in the ngForm.To access the values in the ngForm .We assign the ngform to a templete refernce variable
 *          
 *   **                                        <form #formvalues = "ngForm">

 * **                                          Now for the information from the user to be put in the ngForm ,we have to include the "NGMODULE" whrever the user input is taken       
 **                                             This enables the data from user to be put in ngForm

 * **                                                 
 **                                            Now the information from user to be put in the ngForm is put as a key:value pair     
 **                                             The value is the data from the user ,wwhile the key is the name assigned to the imput via the namme attribute

 *              We can use the ngModule properties instead of the ngClasses by assigning the ngModule to a template refernce variable                                    
 *

 *              The ngModule in a template refernce valiable gives us access to ngModule Properties
 *
 *                                 <input type='number' #templaterefernce="ngModule" [(ngModule)]="usermodule.age" name="house">

 * 
 *                                   In the above case .The food input tag is empty .Therefore the boolean value of the ngmodule prerty is invalid. 
 *                                   We can conditionaly apply a class with red outline(class bindig by puting the class to be rendered in brackete if the condition on the equal sign is met) to an input tag if the boolean value is invalid

 *                                 This ngform is true if all values in the form are valid and its false if all or one value isn't valid
